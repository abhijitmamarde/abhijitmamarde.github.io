      <description>So while, still exploring/playing with Vuejs, came across another peculiar task - making bootstrap&amp;rsquo;s dropdown work with Vuejs, and here is how I make it finally work! (well atleast for me)
Though it seems very straight-forward at first - making the dropdown show or hide based on one flag data attribute. With chrome inspector, I could find out the required css class for same is: open.
But, the challenge was to hide it (remove the open class) once user clicks away outside the dropdown menu.</description>

      <description>Using datepicker with Vuejs2 Ok, so I am learning/exploring Vuejs now a days. It&amp;rsquo;s a great MVVM framework which is light-weight and simple to learn. Simple enough to start without any background with other similar Javascript frameworks.
After going through initial code samples and tutorials, I wanted to go for more. At around same time, working on one side project, I needed to integrate bootstrap-datepicker with Vuejs. Did some search online, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any working solution along with Vuejs2.</description>
